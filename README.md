# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition Model

This project implements a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset. It utilizes fundamental Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data processing, model training, and visualization.

---

## 📚 Description

The model is trained to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9). This is a classic supervised learning task using the **MNIST dataset**, which contains 70,000 labeled images. The primary goal is to achieve accurate recognition of digits using efficient data preprocessing and classification techniques.
